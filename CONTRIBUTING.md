# Contributing to tree-sitter-erlang

First of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :heart::tada::+1:

There's two commands to run:

1. `make` -- this will reformat, compile, and test everything. It's fast enough
   that you can run it often.

2. `make web` -- to build and run the local web ui

3. `make publish` -- to prepare everything for merging and update the playground
